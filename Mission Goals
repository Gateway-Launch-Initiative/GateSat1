From Cory Bennett- My goal, and primary reason for using something like a raspberry pi zero besides  
low-cost, it to explore the efficiency of power generation and system health analysis using off-the-counter piezoelectric ceramics
to bolster manufacture and application of the technology. A piezoelectric transducer can either entirely power or provide backup power
for the zeros, and a surface-bonded piezo-patch can provide 3D structure analysis by analyzing electromagnetic impedance,
and provide better insight into how composite materials deform in space over long periods of time, without compromising other mission
objectives on the CubeSat.
